## Authentication

### Passport.js
- A flexible and modular authentication middleware for Node.js
- Passport JS is used for the initial authentication via LocalStrategy

### JWT
- A token-based authentication system that is used to verify the userâ€™s identity on subsequent requests.
- The JWT is issued once the user logs in and is sent with each protected request to verify the user's authenticity.
- Sent via authentication header
    - Key: authorization
    - Value: Bearer <i>token</i>

### Authentication Flow
1. User Registration
    - The user keys in their username, password, email and account type
    - Both frontend and backend would ensure that the data valid
    - Backend will sanitise all keyed in values
    - Backend will save the values in the MongoDB database

2. User Authentication
    - The user keys in their username and password
    - Frontend will perform basic checks (input not empty, etc)
    - Backend will perform the same checks again, as well as sanitise the input before verifying the user
    - After verifying, backend will return a JWT token back to frontend, which stores it in local storage

3. Accessing protected routes
    - JWT will be sent to backend for verification before the content is returned
    - Will deny access if not authenticated or unauthorised
